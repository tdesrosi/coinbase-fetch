  <p align="center">
    This is a simple web server that posts hourly account balance updates to a google sheet, that I later use to update a personal finance dashboard! It helps me keep track of my finances in ways that I don't even have to be thinking about.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project is made possible via the coinbase api on npmjs. Every 1 hour, a setinterval function fetches my account balance and updates certain rows in a google sheets spreadsheet. Simple, yet elegant!
